# RNA-Sequencing-Analysis-Project
Ewing sarcoma, a type of bone cancer common in children, is caused by the fusion of the Ewing Sarcoma Breakpoint Region 1 gene (EWSR1) and the Friend Leukemia Virus Integration 1 gene (FLI1). This results in a EWS-FLI1 fusion protein, which can then lead to oncogenesis of benign cells. Therefore, the EWSR1-FL1 fusion oncogene  is a therapeutic target for Ewing sarcoma. This project analyzes the impact that EWSR1-FLI1 suppressing therapies has on the transcriptome of Ewing sarcoma cells. 

To learn more about bioinformatics, I analyzed RNA-Seq data to find any potential genes associated with differences in the treated and control Ewing sarcoma samples. I processed a differential gene expression (DGE) analysis to confirm what genes were changed, when comparing samples with the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion gene silenced `shEF1` and the control samples `shCTR`. I found the data and instructions on how to do this from the [Bioinformatic Research Network](https://github.com/Bioinformatics-Research-Network/skill-assessments/tree/main/RNA-Seq%20Analysis).
